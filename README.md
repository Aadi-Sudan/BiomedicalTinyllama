This site allows users to interact directly with a chatbot custom-trained on biomedical data to ask about diagnoses, treatments, and other health-related queries.

The model used was Ollama's open-source TinyLlama 1.1B, fine-tuned on a biomedical question-response dataset from HuggingFace. I used LoRa, Bitsandbytes, PEFT to adjust parameters and training on the tokenized dataset before merging back into the base model. Training resulted in a ROUGE L-sum score of 0.228 and a BERT F1 score of 0.88, indicating that the model is generalizing well and staying on topic without strictly copying the training data responses, which is crucial in a medical model that will be faced with a wide variety of different patient symptoms. 

After training, I exported the model and its weights to be used in a locally hosted webapp. The backend implements FastAPI to load the model in real-time, format and preprocess the prompt, and use the model to generate a response, and the frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JS interface.
